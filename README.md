# InstagramBot
This is an instagram bot i made in Java using Selenium.
Instagram sometimes change his structure, so if it doesn't work, you'll have to modify the xpath in some places... don't worry, it's pretty easy... i'll comment the place that you have to modify in the source code.

Remember that you need [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/es-ES/) installed and [Geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
 so the bot can manipulate the browser.

# Follow (Steal followers)

This option will open another little window where you gotta insert the id of those profiles with followers that you want to steal... i'll put a limit of 100 followers per profile so instagram don't block you... modify it in the source code.

# Unfollow

This will unfollow everyone you're following... it goes quick in the gif because it's a demostration, i recommend you to do it slow, or instagram will block you.

# Comment

Thanks to some arrays with pre-selected words (That you can modify in the source code in the bot class), this option will generate randoms comments and comment it on every photo that appear in your timeline.

Errors? Sometimes it comment twice... sometimes it doesn't even comment, this option is pretty bugged.
